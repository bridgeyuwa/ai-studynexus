**Project Name:** StudyNexus – Your AI-Powered Academic Advisor

---

## 🎓 Project Summary

I'm excited to present my 3MTT showcase project: **StudyNexus**, an AI-driven web platform that helps students find program-specific requirements across institutions in Nigeria with ease.

---

## 🧩 The Problem

Many prospective students struggle to know the exact admission requirements for their chosen programs, especially as they vary across institutions. Manually checking multiple university websites is slow and frustrating.

---

## 💡 What StudyNexus Does

✅ Lets users select an institution, program, and level of study  
✅ AI returns detailed admission requirements specific to that combination  
✅ Reduces stress and guesswork in the admission process  
✅ Ideal for students, parents, and education consultants  

---

## 🔧 Built With

- Laravel + Livewire for a reactive, backend-driven UI  
- Tailwind CSS for clean design  
- MySQL for structured program/institution data  
- Ollama (LLaMA 3.2) for generating natural-language responses from stored program metadata  

---

## 🧠 How AI Was Used

The AI interprets the selected options (institution, level, program) and returns a human-like explanation of the requirements by analyzing structured data — making results easy to understand for users.

---

## 🌍 Why It Matters

With over 1000 tertiary institutions in Nigeria, getting accurate program info is tough. StudyNexus simplifies the process, enabling better, faster educational decisions.

---

## 🔜 Next Steps

- Add more schools and programs  
- Support for direct entry/JAMB filtering  
- Mobile-first redesign  
- Hausa/Igbo/Yoruba translations  

Let’s continue building tools that democratize access to knowledge.
